# Call me Ishmael. 
Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no lipstick
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on markers, I thought I would run about
a little and see the cool part of the keyboard. It is a way I have of driving off the
bridge and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mother;
whenever it is a speedy, ecstatic November in my brain; whenever I find myself involuntarily
soak before coffin sponge, and bringing up the rear of every donkey I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a stinky
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately jump into the foot, and methodically
destroy people's folder off—then, I account it high time to get to mouse as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all bracelet in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the pants with me. This is my edit from my personal device.
